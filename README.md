# notion-news-feed (GFV mentions)

A tiny GitHub Pages page + a `feed.json` file that is automatically refreshed by GitHub Actions.

**Goal:** show the last ~180 days of news that mentions:
- Green Flag Ventures / GFV
- Justin Zeefe
- Deborah Fairlamb

## How to use in Notion
1. Repo → **Settings → Pages**
2. **Build and deployment** → Deploy from branch → `main` → `/ (root)`
3. Copy your GitHub Pages URL and **Embed** it into Notion.

## Files
- `index.html` — the embed UI
- `feed.json` — generated by Actions, read by the UI
- `.github/workflows/update-gfv-feed.yml` — the updater workflow
